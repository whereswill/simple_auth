## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Create an `application.yml` file in the `config` folder. Use the `env_variables_template.yml` file as a guide to set your variables

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, seed the db with development data:

```
$ rails db:seed
```

Run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser. Login to the app using `admin@example.com` and `password` . Enjoy!
